Parallel machines are at their best when the workload is evenly distributed among compute nodes, and idle time is merely a myth.
Unfortunately, strong scaling applications for these platforms has been a challenge as long as they have existed.
In this context, uneven workload distribution and high communication overheads are the main villains when developing parallel applications~\cite{Deveci2015, commaware}.
Concerns towards these problems increase as systems grow in size and performance, consuming more resources, specially power, to solve some the most complex problems in scientific computing~\cite{exapower2015,padoin2017energy}.

Applications such as simulations of molecular dynamics (MD) and hydrodynamics suffer from load imbalance due to their intrinsic dynamic and iterative nature~\cite{namd,IPDPS13:LULESH}.
Although rescheduling algorithms have been able to greatly improve the performance of these applications~\cite{namd}, new approaches are needed to guarantee their performance as parallel systems grow.
Since mapping tasks to processing elements (PEs) is an NP-Hard problem~\cite{npcomplete}, the increase in application data and platform size makes centralized rescheduling approaches inefficient.
This creates a need for scalable and decentralized rescheduling approaches, avoiding both excess of data to process and network contention~\cite{trahay2009scalable}.

The two main paths to achieve scalability in global rescheduling for iterative applications are Hierarchical and Distributed approaches.
Hierarchical load balancing explores parallelism using different approaches for fine-grain and coarse-grain steps~\cite{hybrid}.
Although more scalable, hierarchical approaches are often tied to the limitations of centralized approaches, as data is still aggregated in parent nodes.
On the other hand, distributed load balancing approaches seek to achieve scalability through multiple smaller and decentralized scheduling decisions.
Albeit more scalable than hierarchical approaches, decentralized schedulers have limited system information and often incur in higher amounts of communication.

Despite their notable effectiveness, few are the distributed strategies in the domain of global rescheduling~\cite{diffus,grapevine}.
In this paper, we present the concept of \textit{Batch Task Migration} and a novel distributed global rescheduling algorithm that applies this technique called \packdrop.
Our approach is based on the idea of grouping tasks in batches prior to migration decisions, ultimately decreasing the communication overhead present in the schedule decision time and preserving the locality of migrated tasks~\cite{Paudel2013wslocal}.

% Main contributions

\begin{enumerate}
	\item A highly scalable \textit{Batch Task Migration} approach for distributed rescheduling algorithms;
	\item A novel distributed rescheduling algorithm, \packdrop, using our \textit{Batch Task Migration} approach;
	\item An implementation of our algorithm in a well-known parallel programming model as well as a performance evaluation of this implementation.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Performance Evaluation}

Two platforms were for performance evaluation of our novel \textit{PackDrop} scheduler:
i) A tightly coupled \textit{Supercomputer} with $24$ (in $2$ separate NUMA nodes) PEs per node, using an Infiniband interconnection supported by Intel's Parallel Studio XE implementation of \texttt{MPI} (v2017.4).
ii) A smaller \textit{Cluster} with $4$ PEs per node, using a Gigabit Ethernet interconnection.
Details of both platforms are available on Table~\ref{tab:ptinfo}.

Ahead we'll present the metrics used to compare our new global rescheduling strategy with \textit{Greedy}, \textit{Refine} and \textit{Distributed}.
Then, we'll discuss results obtained in both platforms descripted in Table~\ref{tab:ptinfo} and the scalability of our proposed solution.
All raw data of our results, as well as parsing scripts for analysis are publicly available\footnote{Available at: \texttt{https://github.com/OMMITED-FOR-BLIND-REVIEW}.}.

\subsubsection*{Metrics}

\textit{Application time} is one of the most relevant metrics to evaluate load balancers in \texttt{Charm++}.
Since migrations may induce high overhead and impact communication costs, a bad algorithm may finish fast, but increase imbalance, and thus, application time.

\textit{Iteration times} are fractions of the total application time, and as such can describe how well a scheduling strategy balances the system.
The increasing of iteration times after scheduling is an indicator that the algorithm is not supporting the application well.

\textit{Load balancer decision time}, although not the most relevant for the application itself, the decision time is an indicator of its scalability.
Some centralized schedulers, such as \textit{Greedy}, work very well on local machines, with a reasonable data input.
However, when executing on distributed memory environments, the scalability of these strategies is limited.

\subsection{Evaluation on Supercomputer}

\subsubsection*{Evaluation with Synthetic Load}

\textbf{LB Test} experiments had a total of $35990$ \textit{tasks}, executed over $150$ iterations, performing load balance every $40$ iterations.
\textit{Task} loads vary from $20$ms to $6000$ms. The chosen communication topology was a two-dimensional (2D) mesh.

\subsubsection*{Evaluation with Molecular Dynamics}

\textbf{LeanMD} experiments generated a $10\times15\times10$ space, with a total of $171$K \textit{tasks}.
Each execution ran $100$ iterations, with a first rescheduling step at the $9$th iteration. 
Load balancing was performed every $30$ iterations and each configuration of LeanMD was executed $10$ times, making a total of $1000$ steps per configuration.

\subsection{Evaluation on Cluster}

All experiments ran on cluster were compiled with \texttt{Charm++} using the \texttt{--with-production} option, combined with the specifications detailed on Table~\ref{tab:ptinfo}.
$32$ equal compute nodes were used, with a total of $128$ PEs.
In addition to previously mentioned schedulers, \textit{Dummy} was added as the representative of a situation with no remap of tasks.

\subsubsection*{Evaluation with Synthetic Load}

\textbf{LB Test} experiments had a total of $18990$ \textit{tasks}, executed over $150$ iterations, performing load balance every $40$ iterations.
\textit{Task} loads vary from $30$ms to $9000$ms, which provides reasonable imbalance of load, causing global rescheduling to be useful in this case.
Ring, 2D mesh and 3D mesh communication topologies were used to provide different levels of migration impact and communication cost.

\begin{table}[t]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{l | c | c | c}
    	Scheduler & Time (Ring) & Time (2D) & Time (3D) \\ \hline
        Distributed & $47.49298$s & $48.64839$s & $49.05481$s \\
        Greedy & $46.54101$s & $49.56052$s & $51.06850$s \\
        Dummy & $52.43016$s & $53.17254$s & $53.94068$s \\
        PackDrop & $46.81598$s & $47.37120$s & $47.97426$s \\
        Refine & $45.49095$s & $46.29277$s & $47.21924$s \\		
	\end{tabular}

\end{table}

    \caption{LB Test cluster execution results.}
    \label{fig:eval:g5k:lbtest:apptime}
\end{figure}


Each configuration of the benchmark was executed $15$ times, with results depicted on Figure~\ref{fig:eval:g5k:lbtest:apptime} and Table~\ref{tab:lbtest:apptime}.
Results for \textit{Greedy} show how different communication topologies affect the scheduling performance.
Since \textit{Greedy} migrates many \textit{tasks}, the more they communicate, the more migrations impact the application time.

The increased in communication cost can be verified among all scheduling strategies, but in none as much as in \textit{Greedy}.
Our novel approach, \textit{PackDrop} has outperformed the closest approach, \textit{Distributed} in the \textit{LB Test} case of this scale.
However, since the platform is not large enough to present the potential gains of decentralized strategies, \textit{Refine}, with a reduced migration count approach, still outperforms any other scheduler in this benchmark.

\subsubsection*{Evaluation with Molecular Dynamics}

\textbf{LeanMD} experiments generated a $9\times9\times9$ space, with a total of $27702$ \textit{tasks}.
Each execution ran $500$ iterations, with a first rescheduling step at the $10$th iteration. 
Load balancing periods of every $30$ and every $60$ iterations were used, providing different impacts of rescheduling on the application.

Each configuration of LeanMD was executed $10$ times, making a total of $5000$ steps per configuration.

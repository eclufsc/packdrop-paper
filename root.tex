\begin{abstract}

  Effectively mapping tasks on parallel systems is crucial to assure performance on demanding applications. 
  Throughout the years, global rescheduling of work has been a viable solution to mitigate the problem of load imbalance. 
  As platforms and applications grow, load imbalance becomes a priority issue, and the previous algorithms are not able to deal with it as efficiently. 
  In this paper we propose a novel approach and algorithm to improve decentralized global rescheduling, ultimately reducing communication costs and conserving task locality. 
  We evaluated our approach in two different parallel platforms, using both synthetic load and a molecular dynamics (MD) benchmark, obtaining speedup of up to $3.75$ and $1.15$ on rescheduling time, when compared to centralized and distributed approaches, respectively;
  and up to $1.34$ and $1.22$ on MD application time, when compared to no rescheduling in both our two platforms.

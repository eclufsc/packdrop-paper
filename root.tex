\begin{abstract}

  Effectively mapping tasks of High Performance Computing (HPC) applications on parallel systems is crucial to assure substantial performance gains.
  As platforms and applications grow, load imbalance becomes a priority issue. %, and the previous algorithms are not able to deal with it as efficiently.
  Even though centralized rescheduling has been a viable solution to mitigate this problem, the efficiency of such an approach is not able to keep up with the increasing size of shared memory platforms.
  To efficiently solve load imbalance today, and in the years to come, we should prioritize decentralized strategies developed for large scale platforms.
  In this paper we propose our \textit{Batch Task Migration} approach, and an algorithm implementing it, to improve decentralized global rescheduling, ultimately reducing communication costs and preserving task locality.
  We evaluated our approach in two different parallel platforms, using both synthetic workloads and a molecular dynamics (MD) benchmark. Our solution was able to achieve speedups of up to 3.75x and 1.15x on rescheduling time, when compared to other centralized and distributed approaches, respectively. Moreover, it improved the execution time of MD in up to 1.34x and 1.22x, when compared to a scenario without load balancing on two different platforms.
